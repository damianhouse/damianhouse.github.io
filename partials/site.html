        <p class="me-text second-half">	Since the age of 14 I worked in the food service industry. I split the last decade working at both The Fearrington House Restaurant and Herons at The Umstead Hotel and Spa as a server. While I do enjoy working in the food service industry my interests have always been more focused around the technology industry. Since the age of 9 I've always kept up with the newest technologies, and breakthroughs in science, whether it's photography, javascript frameworks, RAM, SSDs, or iPads. Last year I decided to make the career switch and began taking a web development course online through Udemy, many codecademy courses, and some treehouse courses. While I had developed a solid basic knowledge of web development I realized that the more difficult aspects of the back-end would be much better learned in person. I searched all coding bootcamps in the area, and across the country, and finally settled on The Iron Yard Durham. The Ruby on Rails instructor was Mason Matthews and came highly recommended in the tech community from previous students and other people I met at tech Meetups. Mason has over 20 years programming experience and was a teacher at Duke for several years. The fact that he had prior teaching experience really shined in his Introduction to Ruby Meetup that I attended.</p>
        <p class="me-text">	Since graduating the Ruby on Rails course at The Iron Yard I have been working to become a well rounded programmer. I've stepped outside my comfort zone and been learning AngularJS 1.X, and dabbled in ReactJS, DoneJS, and Meteor but my favorite framework, without question, is Ruby on Rails. Since graduation I have been working in Rails 5 learning to implement WebSockets through the integration of action cable into Rails and have made a few basic apps to demonstrate the usage. I've also been learning the industry standard Devise gem which so beautifully handles user authentication and permissions throughout web applications.</p>
        <p class="me-text">	For the last couple of weeks I've taken over the role of two developers at a small startup here in Durham that provides a team of fitness, and nutrition coaches to help users lose weight and develop better health. In this part time solo developer role I'm working on both front and back-end aspects of the web site and have been working directly with the owner implementing new features and changing the look and feel of the web site.</p>
