        <p class="me-text second-half">I am a recent graduate of the The Iron Yard Durham Ruby on Rails program. Since the age of 14 I worked in the food service industry. I split the last decade working at both The Fearrington House Restaurant and Herons at The Umstead Hotel and Spa as a server. During the summer of 2015 I had the realization that I had capped out in this industry for this area and so I began learning to code.</p>
        <p class="me-text">I spent three rigorous months at The Iron Yard Durham bootcamp for Ruby on Rails and really developed an addiction to coding. Since I graduated I have been satisfying my addiction by learning AngularJS, and. A front end framework that I used to write and design this site.</p>
